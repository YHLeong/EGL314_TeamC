# Final Lighting Sequence

### Design Concept
The lighting design adopts a **galaxy-inspired palette** of **blue, pink, and purple**.  

To maintain audience focus on the **rocket** and the **NeoPixel display**, no complex patterns or distracting effects are used.  

The intention is to create a clean, immersive atmosphere while guiding attention to key stage elements.  

**Implementation Note:**  
All of the cues below can be triggered directly from the **`GUI.py`** file.

- **Trigger Command:**  
  `trigger_gma("Go sequence 13 cue 1")`

  Full-stage wash in galaxy colors to establish mood, while still maintaining the room to be well lit enough for placement of chairs.

- **Cue 2 – Button Focus**  
  Concentrated lighting highlighting the button to draw audience attention.

- **Cue 3 – Tension Build ("ARE YOU READY")**  
  Accent lighting sequence designed to create anticipation before the game begins.
