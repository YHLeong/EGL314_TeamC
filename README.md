## Physical connections and Props

Cabling
- 2x LAN cable

Since there are six sensors I needed twelve wires in total. I didn't want to use jumper wires as there would be too many points of failure over a long cable. I decided to use LAN cables by isolating two wires per sensor. Since a LAN cable only has four pairs and I needed six, I used two LAN cables.

Props
-  Buttons
-  Screen holder
-  Board for Neoopixel
-  Holders for Neopixel board
-  Box to house electronics

We are using cardboard to make everything. For the buttons, we layered two pieces of cardboard and carved numbers into the top two layers to create a 3D effect. I then inserted the sensor inbetween the pieces of cardboard.

For the screen holder, we used glue and cardboard to make an angled piece of cardboard with a hole for the screen. 

In our games story, we need a box to act as a power generator, we decided to use a painted cardboard box to hide our electronics.

For the Neopixel, we used nano tape to tape the neopixel to the board in a lightning pattern. We also made sure to leave some excess that could drop behind the box we are using to hide all the electronics.

## 💡 Code Logic

## 🎲 Random Number Generator - [Click Here](https://github.com/YHLeong/EGL314_TeamC/blob/main/Backlog%202%20sprint%201/RandomNumberGenerator_v4.py)
#### 🧾 Overview

This Python script continuously generates and prints sequences of random integers. Each sequence has a length that cycles through **4**, **8**, and **12**, refreshing every **1 second** until the user stops the script with **Ctrl+C**.

---

### 📚 Python Packages Used
```
import random
import time
```
#### 🎰random
Purpose: Used to generate random integers.
<br>
Function Used: random.randint(a, b) returns a random integer N such that a <= N <= b.

#### ⏰time
Purpose: Provides time-related functions. 
<br>
Function Used: time.sleep(seconds) pauses program execution for the given number of seconds.

### 🔄Index Tracker

```
sequence_lengths = [4, 8, 12]
current_index = 0  # Start at 4
```
- Tracks the current position in the sequence_lengths list.
- Initially set to 0, meaning the sequence will start with a length of 4.

### 🔁Main Loop
```
while True:
  ...
```
- An infinite loop (while True) is used to continuously generate sequences.
- The loop continues until the user stops it manually (e.g., with Ctrl+C).

### 🧮Sequence Generation
```
seq_length = sequence_lengths[current_index]
sequence = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(seq_length)]
```
- Retrieves the current sequence length using the current_index.
- Generates a list of random integers between 1 and 6 (inclusive), simulating dice rolls.
- Uses list comprehension for concise generation.

### 📤Output
```
print(f"Generated sequence ({seq_length} numbers): {sequence}")
```
- Prints the generated sequence along with the number of elements.

### ➕Index Update
```
current_index = (current_index + 1) % len(sequence_lengths)
```
- Updates current_index to point to the next length in the list.
- Uses modulo (%) to cycle back to the start when the end is reached.

### ⏳Delay
```
time.sleep(1)
```
- Waits for 1 second before generating the next sequence.
- Helps maintain a steady interval between outputs.

### ✋Graceful Exit
```
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nExiting... Program stopped by user.")
```
- Allows the user to stop the program gracefully using Ctrl + C.
- Catches the KeyboardInterrupt exception and prints a message before exiting.

---

### 🧭 GPIO Setup
```
SENSOR_MAP = {1: 17, 2: 6, 3: 19, 4: 16, 5: 20, 6: 21}
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
for pin in SENSOR_MAP.values():
    GPIO.setup(pin, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
```
- Six sensors are mapped to GPIO pins.
- Input pins use pull-up resistors (active-low).
- BCM mode used for pin numbering.
---

### 🖥️ GUI Layout
```
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Sensor Sequence Challenge")
```
- Main Window: Title set to "Sensor Sequence Challenge".

```
timer_label = tk.Label(...)  
sequence_label = tk.Label(...)  
result_label = tk.Label(...)  
labels_frame = tk.Frame(root)
```
- Timer Label: Shows time remaining for current stage.
- Sequence Label: Shows instructions and sequence step-by-step.
- Result Label: Displays success/failure feedback.
- Sensor Labels: Dynamically update with sensor states ("Pressed"/"Not Pressed").


---

### 🎮 Game Flow
```
steps_per_stage = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12]
difficulties = ["Easy", "Medium", "Hard"]
```
- Stages: 9 in total, increasing step complexity.
- Grouped into: 3 difficulty levels × 3 stages each.
  
### 🔢 Sequence Generation
```
full_sequence = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(12)]
```
- A full 12-step random sequence is generated at the start and split across stages.

### 👁️ Displaying Sequence
```
def show_sequence_step_by_step(seq, length):
    def show_next(index):
        if index < length:
            sequence_label.config(text=f"Sequence Number {index + 1}: {seq[index]}")
            root.after(1000, show_next, index + 1)
        else:
            sequence_label.config(text=f"Repeat the first {length} steps using sensors!")
            start_sensor_monitoring()
    show_next(0)
```
- Displays the sequence one number per second using `root.after`.
- Informs the player when it's time to repeat the steps using sensors.
- Monitoring only starts after the full display finishes.

### 🧠 Sensor Monitoring
```
def update_sensor_status():
    if sensor_monitoring_enabled:
        current_time = time.time()
        sensor_press_count = {k: user_input.count(k) for k in SENSOR_MAP}

        for sensor_num, pin in sorted(SENSOR_MAP.items()):
            pin_state = GPIO.input(pin)
            status = "Pressed" if pin_state == GPIO.LOW else "Not Pressed"
            labels[sensor_num].config(text=f"Sensor {sensor_num} (Pin {pin}): {status}")

            was_pressed_before = last_pressed.get(pin, True)
            if was_pressed_before and pin_state == GPIO.LOW:
                last_time = last_press_time.get(pin, 0)
                if current_time - last_time > DEBOUNCE_DELAY:
                    if sensor_press_count.get(sensor_num, 0) < 2:
                        user_input.append(sensor_num)
                        last_press_time[pin] = current_time
                        if len(user_input) == len(current_sequence):
                            check_user_sequence()
            last_pressed[pin] = pin_state

        root.after(100, update_sensor_status)

```
- Polls GPIO pins every 100ms to detect button presses.
- Debounce protection: Only accepts inputs spaced by `DEBOUNCE_DELAY = 0.5` seconds.
- Press limit: Each sensor can only be pressed twice per round.
- Inputs get appended to `user_input` until it matches expected length.



### ✔️ Sequence Validation
```
def check_user_sequence():
    global sensor_monitoring_enabled
    sensor_monitoring_enabled = False
    cancel_round_timer()
    expected = current_sequence[:len(user_input)]
    if user_input == expected:
        result_label.config(text="✅ Correct sequence!", fg="green")
        sequence_completed.set()
    else:
        result_label.config(text=f"❌ Wrong sequence!\nExpected: {expected}\nYou: {user_input}", fg="red")
```
- Compares player input to the expected segment of the full sequence.
- Displays ✅ if correct, ❌ if wrong (with expected vs. actual).
- Ends stage on validation result.

### ⏱️ Countdown Timer
```
def start_timer(seq_length):
    total_time = TIMER_MAP.get(seq_length, 30)
    def countdown():
        nonlocal total_time
        while total_time > 0 and not sequence_completed.is_set():
            mins, secs = divmod(total_time, 60)
            timer_label.config(text=f" Time Left: {mins:02d}:{secs:02d}")
            time.sleep(1)
            total_time -= 1
        if not sequence_completed.is_set():
            timer_label.config(text=" Time's up!")
            timer_failed.set()
```
- The timer starts only after the sequence is shown.
- Counts down in real time and ends the round on timeout.
---

### 🧵 Threaded Execution
```
threading.Thread(target=run_sequence_challenge, daemon=True).start()
```
- Main game loop runs on a background thread.
- Keeps GUI responsive and prevents freezing during time delays or blocking calls.
---

### 🧩 Stage Logic
```
def play_stage(seq, stage_length):
    global current_sequence
    current_sequence = seq[:stage_length]
    sequence_completed.clear()

    root.after(0, lambda: sequence_label.config(text="Generating sequence..."))
    root.after(0, lambda: result_label.config(text=""))
    root.after(0, lambda: [label.config(text=f"Sensor {num} (Pin {pin}): Waiting...") for num, pin in SENSOR_MAP.items()])
    root.after(0, lambda: labels_frame.pack_forget())

    root.after(1000, lambda: show_sequence_step_by_step(current_sequence, stage_length))

    while not sequence_completed.is_set():
        time.sleep(0.1)

    return sequence_completed.is_set()
```
- Each stage resets labels and displays the assigned sequence portion.
- Waits for user to complete input or timeout.
- Returns whether the user passed the stage.
---

### 🚦 GUI Main Loop & Cleanup
```
try:
    root.mainloop()
finally:
    GPIO.cleanup()
```
- Main GUI loop keeps the window running.
- On exit (even via Ctrl+C), GPIO pins are reset properly to avoid hangups or damage.
---

### ✋ Graceful Exit
```
finally:
    GPIO.cleanup()
```
- Ensures all GPIO pins are released properly.
- Required for hardware stability and avoiding pin lockups after crash or forced quit.

```

---

#### ⏱️ Advanced Function: `trigger_reaper_with_delay()`

```python
def trigger_reaper_with_delay(marker_addr, play_addr, stop_addr, delay=20):
    """Jump to marker, trigger play, wait for delay, then trigger stop - runs in background"""
    def delayed_sequence():
        trigger_reaper(marker_addr)  # Jump to marker first
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Small delay to ensure marker jump completes
        trigger_reaper(play_addr)  # Trigger play
        time.sleep(delay)  # Wait for specified delay
        trigger_reaper(stop_addr)  # Trigger stop
    # Run in background thread so it doesn't block game logic
    threading.Thread(target=delayed_sequence, daemon=True).start()
```

##### 🎯 Purpose
- **Complete audio sequence** management: Jump → Play → Stop

## Lighting Control with grandMA3 (via OSC)

### Summary

Lighting(grandMA3) in this project is handled by sending **OSC** messages to grandMA3 through the /gma3/cmd command. These messages execute the commands remotely, which enables **real-time** control of lighting sequences and cues directly from Python.

---

### 🔌 Core Command Example

```python
gma_client.send_message("/gma3/cmd", "Go Sequence 23 cue 1")
```


#### 🎯Purpose
- This sends a single string command to the grandMA3 console, which matches the syntax and naming of preconfigured sequences and cues in the showfile.

### grandMA3 Command Function 1️⃣:`shutdown_sequences(level)`
```python
def shutdown_sequences(level):
    cues = ["23 cue 1", "23 cue 2", "23 cue 3", "23 cue 4"]
    for cue in cues:
        gma_client.send_message("/gma3/cmd", f"Off Sequence {cue}")
```

#### 🎯Purpose
- **Deactivates** all cues at the end of each stage
- Ensures lighting state is **reset** before the next round begins.
- Prevent any unintended visual **overlapping** from previous cues

#### 💡 Usage
```python
shutdown_sequences(current_level)
```

### grandMA3 Command Function 2️⃣: `trigger_osc(count)`
```python
def trigger_osc(count):
    if current_level in milestones:
        if count == milestones[current_level][0]:
            gma_client.send_message("/gma3/cmd", "Go Sequence 23 cue 1")
        elif count == milestones[current_level][1]:
            gma_client.send_message("/gma3/cmd", "Go Sequence 23 cue 2")
        elif count == milestones[current_level][2]:
            gma_client.send_message("/gma3/cmd", "Go Sequence 23 cue 3")
        elif count == milestones[current_level][3]:
            gma_client.send_message("/gma3/cmd", "Go Sequence 23 cue 4")
```

#### 🎯Purpose
- **Triggers** lighting cues in grandMA3 based on player's progress
- Provides **visual feedback** at fixed percentages like 25%, 50%

### grandMA3 Command Function 3️⃣: `GameUI.trigger_startup_sequence(self, event=None)`
```python
def trigger_startup_sequence(self, event=None):
    self.show_game_result("Startup")
    gma_client.send_message("/gma3/cmd", "Go Sequence 38 cue 3")
    time.sleep(0.3)
    gma_client.send_message("/gma3/cmd", "Go+ Sequence 41")
    time.sleep(0.9)
    startup_complete = True
    self.show_game_result("Ready")
```

#### 🎯Purpose
- Initates the game's lighting system by activating sequences in grandMA3
- Provides a visual startup animation
- Sets internal game state flags to mark startup as complete

## Lighting Sequence Configuration
| Sequence/Cue |  Action            | 
|:------------:|:------------------:|
|   23         | Charging lights    | 
|   106        | Lose game          | 
|   105        | Win game           | 
|   104 cue 4  | Lights during game |
|   104 cue 5  | Players lights     |

# Final

### Final - [Click Here](./Final/)

### 🧾 Overview
The Final build consolidates the game into a stable release with:
- Debounced REAPER action triggering and direct marker events
- Refined milestone → lighting/audio mapping
- Manual UI controls for lighting and audio
- Clear network endpoints for GrandMA3, REAPER, and the local OSC listener


```python
GMA_IP, GMA_PORT       = "192.168.254.213", 2000  # GrandMA3 Console
REAPER_IP, REAPER_PORT = "192.168.254.12",   8000 # REAPER Audio
LOCAL_IP, LOCAL_PORT   = "192.168.254.108",  8006 # OSC listener (Pi)

gma    = udp_client.SimpleUDPClient(GMA_IP, GMA_PORT)
reaper = udp_client.SimpleUDPClient(REAPER_IP, REAPER_PORT)
```

- GrandMA3: Receives lighting commands at `/gma3/cmd`
- REAPER: Receives action/marker commands at `/action/...` or `/marker/...`
- Local OSC: Listens on `LOCAL_IP:LOCAL_PORT` for sensor events on `/print`

## Final Build — REAPER Audio Control Functions

### Overview
Audio control uses a debounced wrapper to prevent rapid duplicate triggers, plus direct marker calls for stage/game events. This mirrors MVP but adds cooldown and transport-prepare actions.

### Debounced Action Sender: `trigger_reaper(marker: str)`

```python
MARKER_COOLDOWN = 0.6      # seconds
last_marker_time = {}      # marker -> last time sent

def trigger_reaper(marker: str):
    """Debounced wrapper to fire a REAPER action only once per cooldown window."""
    now = time.time()
    if marker in last_marker_time and (now - last_marker_time[marker]) < MARKER_COOLDOWN:
        return
    last_marker_time[marker] = now
    reaper.send_message("/action/40044", 1.0)   # optional: prepare/jump mode
    reaper.send_message(f"/action/{marker}", 1.0)
    reaper.send_message("/action/40045", 1.0)   # optional: resume/confirm
```

#### Purpose
- Prevents duplicate REAPER actions if a sensor bounces.
- Wraps action calls with optional pre/post actions (`40044/40045`) for safer transport behavior.

#### Usage Examples
```python
trigger_reaper("41261")  # Load Sound 1
trigger_reaper("41270")  # Win Stage
```

### Direct Marker Triggers (events)
Final build uses direct `/marker/...` for some events (no debounce):

```python
reaper.send_message("/marker/18", 1.0)  # Stage Fail
reaper.send_message("/marker/19", 1.0)  # Game Win
reaper.send_message("/marker/20", 1.0)  # Game Lose
```

### Milestone Integration: `trigger_osc(n)`

```python
def trigger_osc(n):
    # Maps four milestones per level to GMA cues and REAPER actions 41261..41264
    # Ensures each milestone audio is fired once per level
```

#### Purpose
- Couples player progress to both lighting cues and REAPER audio per milestone.
- Guarantees each milestone triggers once using an in-level `played_milestones` set.

### Game Startup (manual)

```python
def start_sequence(...):
    gma.send_message("/gma3/cmd", "Go Sequence 102 cue 5")
    ...
    trigger_reaper("41100")  # Startup audio
```
